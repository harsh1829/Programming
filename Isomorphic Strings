Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true

public boolean isIsomorphic(String s, String t) {
    Map<Character, Integer> charToIndex_s = new HashMap<>();
    Map<Character, Integer> charToIndex_t = new HashMap<>();

    for (Integer i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i)
      if (charToIndex_s.put(s.charAt(i), i) != charToIndex_t.put(t.charAt(i), i))
        return false;

    return true;
  }
  
  Time Complexity : O(n)
